The Olympiad has the following rules.<br>
The Olympiad opens every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday between 22:00 and 23:00.<br>
Up to 5 matches are allowed per day.<br>
The cycle of an Olympiad is weekly between Monday-Saturday, and the registration closes at 23:00 on Saturday.<br>
Those who are qualified to participate in the Olympiad will receive 1000 Olympiad Points when the cycle begins, and can obtain more Olympiad Points by winning matches.<br>
To become a hero, you must participate in at least 10 matches, and when the Olympiad cycle ends, the player with the highest points per class will become a hero. (You must participate in at least 10 matches to have the previous week's record displayed in the Olympiad window.) <br>
The winner of an Olympiad match is determined by how much damage the participants inflict on each other.<br>
Damage inflicted on servitors does not affect the outcome of the match.<br>
