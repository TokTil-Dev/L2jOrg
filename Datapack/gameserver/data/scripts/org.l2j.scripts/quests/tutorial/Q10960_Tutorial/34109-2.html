<br>I'm the leader of the Jin Kamaels, Elder Lukenir.
<br>You just awoke from the deep sleep and got the seal removed, so you might not remember me.
<br>The Jin Kamaels have free will and have even chosen to live in seclusion.
<br>Now is time to go out into the world. Did you finish the training with the Newbie Helper?
